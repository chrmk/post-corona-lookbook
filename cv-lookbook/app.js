While our lifestyle has radically changed over the last decades, the fundamental need for meaningful relationships has not. Boosting social bonds, therefore, requires different approaches than throughout most of our evolutionary history, not only during this crisis, but also in a Post-Corona world.",

Research shows that previous outbreaks of similar diseases have had lasting mental health effects, undermining the importance of proactive efforts. Moreover, subsequent habit formation during a lockdown suggests that emerging health trends will not regress in post-crisis scenarios. Consequently, besides a general acceleration of mental health problems, we expect tendencies towards a retraditionalization of gender roles, increased risks in child development, rising demand for online health care, and a trend to home cooking to substantially affect society in the long-run.",
