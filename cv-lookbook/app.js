        summary: "Social distancing is an unprecedented challenge for humans. It deprives us of most physical connections with other people and alters the few social interactions still allowed. At the same time, the COVID-19 measures highlight pre-crisis societal trends such as increasing isolation and loneliness, long-distance relationships, and new work. While our lifestyle has radically changed over the last decades, the fundamental need for meaningful relationships has not. Boosting social bonds, therefore, requires different approaches than throughout most of our evolutionary history, not only during this crisis, but also in a Post-Corona world.",
