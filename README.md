# CDTM Center Venture 2020:
# Post-Corona Lookbook on Social Relationships

## „Prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022“, 
says the Harvard School of Public Health. 

In this year’s ad-hoc Center Venture, students, alumni and PhD students of the CDTM examined how social distancing will impact our social relationships and what innovators could do about it. We identifed nine trends, which will affect our social relationships in the upcoming months. Furthermore, we ideated promising business opportunities around the trends. Building on methods of future studies, our team developed a concept and a business model for a game which fosters meaningful conversations with friends, family, and partners.
