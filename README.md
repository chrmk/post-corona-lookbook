# CDTM Center Venture 2020:<br>Lookbook on Social Bonding in a Post-Corona World

> „Prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022“,  
says the Harvard School of Public Health.  

With our business opportunity lookbook, we want to inspire future innovators to help people whose personal relationships suffered from contact restrictions due to
Corona. We uncover promising business opportunities to strengthen social bond for a post-corona world.  

In this year’s ad-hoc Center Venture, students, alumni and PhD students of the CDTM examined how social distancing will impact our social relationships and what innovators could do about it. We identifed nine trends, which will affect our social relationships in the upcoming months. Furthermore, we ideated promising business opportunities around the trends. Building on methods of future studies, our team developed a concept and a business model for a game which fosters meaningful conversations with friends, family, and partners.
